## üé¨ Animation System

### GSAP Animations
**Primary Use**: Scroll-triggered animations and complex sequences

**Key Features**:
- ScrollTrigger for viewport-based animations
- Timeline animations for complex sequences
- Easing functions for natural motion
- Performance-optimized animations

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
gsap.fromTo(".hero-title", 
  { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 1, ease: "power2.out" }
);
```

### CSS Transitions
**Primary Use**: Hover effects and state changes

**Key Features**:
- Smooth property transitions
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Responsive design considerations
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Implementation Example**:
```css
.card {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
  transform: scale(1);
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
```

### Styled Components Animations
**Primary Use**: Component-specific animations

**Key Features**:
- Props-based animation control
- Transient props for performance
- Conditional animations
- Theme integration

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
const AnimatedCard = styled.div`
  opacity: ${props => props.$show ? '1' : '0'};
  transform: ${props => props.$show ? 'translateY(0)' : 'translateY(20px)'};
  transition: opacity 1s ease, transform 1s ease;
`;
```
